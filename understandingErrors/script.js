// An error is a type of object built into the JS language, consisting of a name/type and a message

const a = "Hello";
const b = "World";

// console.log(c);

// This example of an error is a ReferenceError. It is thrown when one refers to a variable that is not declared and/or initialized within the current scope. 

// In the error message it will give the name of the file and the location of where the problematic code is.

//Another important part of an error is the stack trace

const c = 5;
const d = 6;

function add(){
    return e;
}

function print(){
    add();
}

print();
